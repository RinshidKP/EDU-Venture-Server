# EDU-Venture Server

Welcome to EDU-Venture Server, the backend component of EDU-Venture, a comprehensive study abroad website offering consultant services and courses for students interested in studying abroad. This repository houses the server-side codebase responsible for handling data management, user authentication, and facilitating communication features such as live chat.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access protected endpoints.
- **Consultant Services:** Provides a platform for multiple consultants to offer their services, including personalized consultations and course recommendations for students.
- **Courses:** Offers a wide range of courses for students interested in studying abroad, covering various subjects and academic levels.
- **Live Chat:** Enables real-time communication between students and consultants, supporting text messages, video messages, photos, audio recordings, and file sharing.
- **Search, Sort, and Filter:** Allows users to easily search for consultants and courses, sorting and filtering results based on different criteria to find the most relevant information.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** A flexible and scalable NoSQL database used for storing user data, consultant information, course details, and chat messages.
- **Express.js:** A minimalist web framework for Node.js used to build the RESTful API endpoints, handle HTTP requests, and manage routing.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that executes server-side code, providing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture ideal for building scalable web applications.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON objects, used for implementing user authentication and authorization.
